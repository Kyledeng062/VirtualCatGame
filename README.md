# VirtualCatGame
Welcome to your very own virtual pet adventure!
\nIn this Python-based game, you'll take care of an adorable pixel-style kitten. Your mission is to keep your pet happy and healthy through daily interactions.
\nWhat you can do:
\nFeed your cat to keep its hunger level high.
\nPlay with your cat to improve its happiness.
\nHeal your cat when it gets sick—if left untreated, your pet could sadly pass away.
\nGame Mechanics:
\nYour cat’s hunger and happiness automatically decrease each day.
\nEach day, you earn Cat Coins, which you can use to:
\nBuy one of three toys to increase happiness;
\nBuy one of two food to increase happiness;
\nPurchase a healing item to recover from illness.
\nIf your cat’s hunger or happiness drops too low for too long, it will get sick and require medical care.
\nStay consistent with your care—your kitten depends on you!
\nKeep it well-fed, entertained, and healthy, and you'll build a lasting bond in this cozy virtual world.
