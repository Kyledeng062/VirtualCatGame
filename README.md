# VirtualCatGame
Welcome to your very own virtual pet adventure!
In this Python-based game, you'll take care of an adorable pixel-style kitten. Your mission is to keep your pet happy and healthy through daily interactions.
What you can do:
Feed your cat to keep its hunger level high.
Play with your cat to improve its happiness.
Heal your cat when it gets sick—if left untreated, your pet could sadly pass away.
Game Mechanics:
Your cat’s hunger and happiness automatically decrease each day.
Each day, you earn Cat Coins, which you can use to:
Buy one of three toys to increase happiness;
Buy one of two food to increase happiness;
Purchase a healing item to recover from illness.
If your cat’s hunger or happiness drops too low for too long, it will get sick and require medical care.
Stay consistent with your care—your kitten depends on you!
Keep it well-fed, entertained, and healthy, and you'll build a lasting bond in this cozy virtual world.
